# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository explores predictive modeling of the Titanic Survival prediction outcomes during disembarkation using structured data from Kaggle, using regression and classification techniques to analyze the relationship between various passenger characteristics and survival outcomes:

## Objectives

* Identify the most important features affecting survival
* Analyze patterns based on demographics and socioeconomic status
* Build and compare machine learning models
* Evaluate model performance using standard metrics

## Summary of Workdone

### Data

* Dataset:
  * Type:
    * Input: CSV file containing race data (drivers, grid position, constructors, lap times, etc.)
    * Output: Regression: finishing position, Classification: top 10 finish (binary)
  * Size: Dataset includes multiple seasons (2020–2025). Thousands of race entries

* Preprocessing / Cleaning: 
  * Removed or handled missing values using forward fill and drop methods
  * Converted categorical variables (constructor, driver) using one-hot encoding
  * Created new feature: top10 (1 if position ≤ 10, else 0)

* Data Visualization: 
  * Scatter plot of grid position vs finishing position showed strong correlation
  * Observed that drivers starting near the front tend to finish higher
  * Some variability exists due to race conditions and performance

### Problem Formulation

* Define:
  * Input:
    * Grid position
    * Constructor (encoded)
    * Driver (encoded)
    * Performance metrics
  * Output:
    * Regression: finishing position
    * Classification: top 10 (binary)
  * Models: 
    * Linear Regression → baseline for regression
    * Decision Tree Classifier → interpretable classification model
  * Hyperparameters:
    * Default sklearn parameters used for simplicity
    * Train/test split: 80/20

### Training

* Method: 
  * Implemented using Python and scikit-learn
  * Trained on local machine (Jupyter Notebook)
* Training Time: 
  * Very fast (few seconds due to small dataset size)
* Training Process: 
  * Fit model on training data
  * Evaluated on test data
* Stopping Criteria: 
  * Single-pass training (no iterative epochs required)
* Challenges: 
  * Handling categorical variables
  * Managing missing values

### Performance Comparison

* Metrics: 
  * Regression: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  * Classification: Accuracy
* Results:
  
| Model | Task | Performance |
| :--- | :---: | ---: |
| Linear Regression | Regression | Moderate MSE |
| Decision Tree | Classification | Good Accuracy |

### Conclusions

* Grid position is a strong predictor of race outcome
* Team (constructor) also significantly impacts performance
* Race outcomes are not perfectly predictable due to randomness (pit stops, weather, crashes)

### Future Work

* Implement a Random Forest ML model
* Include additional features such as weather conditions and pit stop strategies
* Use time-series modeling for race progression
* Perform hyperparameter tuning

### Overview of files in repository

* Describe the directory structure, if any.
* List all relevant files and describe their role in the package.
* An example:
  * utils.py: various functions that are used in cleaning and visualizing data.
  * preprocess.ipynb: Takes input data in CSV and writes out data frame after cleanup.
  * visualization.ipynb: Creates various visualizations of the data.
  * models.py: Contains functions that build the various models.
  * training-model-1.ipynb: Trains the first model and saves model during training.
  * training-model-2.ipynb: Trains the second model and saves model during training.
  * training-model-3.ipynb: Trains the third model and saves model during training.
  * performance.ipynb: loads multiple trained models and compares results.
  * inference.ipynb: loads a trained model and applies it to test data to create kaggle submission.

* Note that all of these notebooks should contain enough text for someone to understand what is happening.
